# Approaches to automating counting wing cells on a Drosophila adult wing.

THis is currently less a protocol, and more a list of different approaches that are currently being used (along with some references)

## [FijiWings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23797110)

This is NIH IMage/Fiji set of [macros](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fijiwings/) to help capture all of the wing trichomes and estimate cell number. It is not super clear how well this works, 
it works. I have found it a bit frustrating to use. They have a [primer](https://youtu.be/kkwbRaN51ww) for Fijiwings 2.2 on youtube




## Other Considerations

### Image Quality
I assume that a higher quality (and "larger") image will be best. Need to test this.

### Colour vs mono
Which is best?

### Contrast

### Depth of field

### Brightness

### Mounting media

### Objective
Assume the highest quality objective that will fit the whole wing in the field of view is best (i.e. a 4X or 5X plan apochromatic lense)

### Brightfield upright? Brightfield inverted? stereoscope (white or black background)?
