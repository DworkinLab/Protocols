# Some notes on staging and synchronizing Drosophila larval development

Synchronization of larval development is important for staging and making sure we are comparing "apples" to "apples" across strains (i.e. making sure that differences in gene expression reflect strain differences at the same stage, not just relative developmental rates of each strain). However, even when larvae are developmentally synchronized by collecting freshly hatched 1st instar larvae, there is often as much as 12 hour difference in how long it takes such strains to reach the beginning of pupation. In addition to variation among different wild type strains, many developmental mutants also show developmental delay. So absolute age is not a good indicator of developmental stage (and we generally want the tissues at the same developmental stage not the same temporal age).

In Ashburner et al. *Drosophila* A laboratory Handbook (big book, light blue cover) see chapter 6, in particular figures 6.15 (mouthparts for different larval instars), 6.16 (anterior spiracles), table 6.7 (number of teeth in mouthhooks), Fig 6.18 and 6.22. Essentially pages 150-157.
