# Some unorganized notes on using Hoechst (or DAPI) as a general nuclear co-stain

 We want to figure out optimal Hoechst concentrations for imaginal disc work. What has been reported in the literature is all over the place both in terms of stock concentration and final concentration. Also whether the stock solution should be in water, PBS or DMSO!!! So here are a few unorganized notes copied from other places, that should be used to figure things out.
 
 
DAPI concentrations  anywhere from 0.1µg/mL to 10µg/mL final concentration

-Also, it's good to note, as Matthew Larkins said, that DAPI/Hoescht works at a range of concentrations. If you're interested in chromatin compaction, for instance, high concentrations will only result in an entirely blue kind of blown-out looking nucleus, while low concentrations will reveal differences between chromocenters, interchromatin space, heterochromatin and euchromatin.
-I use 1.5ug/ml but added to mounting media so I don't incubate or wash. I just add the mounting media and cover slip.

Hoechst (stock concentrations either 1mg/mL or 10mg/mL). typically dilute Hoechst stock 1:2000 or so.
0.2 - 2 µg/ml final(?) - the range of 1-10 µg/mL

Notes about hoechst concentration for various protocols

From the FACS protocol from the Edgar lab
Final concentration is 0.5ug/mL) made from a 500ug/mL stock solution (dissolved in DMSO.. check for antibody staining). The reasoning for DMSO is that when it is made in a PBS based solution it would precipitate out of solution.
