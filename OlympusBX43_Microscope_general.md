# Using the Olympus BX43 Microscope

These are some general notes for using the Olympus BX 43 "upright" microscope in room 413LSB.

##General notes
This scope was purchased and optimized for two purposes. 
1. Getting very high quality images at relatively low magnification (2.5X and 4X objectives). In particular for adult morphological structures of Drosophila (wings and legs). These use plan apochromatic objectives (to maximize resolution and flatness of field).
2. Getting high quality images of the developing structures (imaginal discs) for wings, legs, etc. We also have the plan apochromatic objectives for these. At higher magnification parallaxes increases (less flatness of field).

- As such, this scope has the highest quality 2X, 4X, 10X, 20X and 40X objectives (PLAN- apochromatic, see [here](http://www.olympus-lifescience.com/en/objectives/uplsapo/)  and [here](http://www.olympus-lifescience.com/en/objectives/plapon/) for more details. In particular these objectives had the highest numerical aperature I could afford, which (in combination with a good camera) should provide excellent detail of the images, including for counting wing hairs (cells) on the wing. These are also corrected for flatness of image (PLAN). However we still have to empirically test how well this flatness correction works (parallax distortions near edge).

- This microscope does not do Nomarksi (Differential Interference Contrast), or phase contrast. If you need this for your project, let me know as there are several other excellent microscopes in the building with this capability.

- The current filters for fluorescent microscopy are for [DAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAPI), [Texas Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Red) (possibly including Alexa594, DyLight594?), Fluorescien/[FITC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_isothiocyanate) (Alexa 488, DyLight488), [TRITC](), GFP and mCherry. More information on each of the filter sets is below.

- As is commonly the case, the higher magnification lenses (10X, 20X and 40X) need to be used with the condensor in, so you will need to set up the microscope under [Kohler Illumination](http://microscopy.berkeley.edu/courses/TLM/condenser/kohler.html). This takes less than 1 minute, and is worth checking each time when you are using the scope.
