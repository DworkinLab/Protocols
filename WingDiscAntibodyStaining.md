Antibody Staining of Imaginal discs and larval ovaries
=====================================================

(based on Godt 1992, with Modifications by Dworkin. Also see White, R. 1998. Immunolabelling of Drosophila in Drosophila a practical approach. Roberts. DB ed. Oxford press)

**Dissection**: Dissect larvae in 1xPBS in depression slides. Remove fat body and salivary glands (optional). Transfer tissue (inverted head with wing discs) directly with forcepts into a tube or well of a micro-titer plate. Keep on ice until fixation. Use 500ul of solution per tube. Generally 10-12 "heads" per tube work.
	
**Fixation**: Fix 20 min. at room temperature (RT). Keep the tube/plate with tissue on a nutator throughout this, and all subsequent steps. 

	•	4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in 1x PBS with 50mM EGTA  (from a 0.5M stock of EGTA - may require NaOH to dissolve). This solution should be made in advance (in the fumehood, on a stir/heating plate), and stored in 1mL aliquots at -20 degrees celsius. Mix well before adding fixative to tissues.
	•	Be aware of that 4% paraformaldehyde with EGTA may not work. In that case, use 4% paraformaldehyde without EGTA.

**Methanol**: Transfer tissue directly with forceps into a basket with methanol in a micro-titer plate. 500ul per well for 3~5 min. at RT. **Note:** _Some antibodies show low binding activity with methanol fixed tissues_.

	•	for storage at -20 degrees, remove methanol & add 100% ethanol after methanol fixation.
	•	Skip this step for alpha-CT antibody

**Wash**: Rinse with PBT, wash 4x15 min (or 3x20 minutes). with PBT.
	•	PBT = 1x PBS & 0.1% Tween-20. This is a good time to “clean-up” tissues post fixation (remove fat etc.)
	•	Make 50ml in a tube. Do not vortex PBT. Gently invert several times.
	•	Be aware of that Tween-20 has a high viscosity.

**Blocking**: in 750~1000ul of  PBTBS from 1 hour to overnight (O.N.) at 4 degrees. 
	•	PBTBS = PBT + 0.1% Bovine serum albumin + 2% Goat serum.
	•	PBTBS can be kept for 2~3 days at 4 degrees. 
	•	To make 3ml PBTBS :
		60ul GS(100% solution) + 40ul BSA(7.5% solution) + 2900ul PBT
	        Do not vortex GS but BSA is vortex-able.

**Incubate with primary antibody**: in 1000ul of antibody w/ PBTBS overnight (O.N.) At 4 degrees Celsius. Some antibodies need to be pre-absorbed. 
	•	dilute antibody with PBTBS & invert genetly or pipette to mix.


**Wash**: Rise with PBT; wash 4x 15min. RT.

**Blocking**: 60 minutes to O.N. In PBTBS at 4 degrees. 

**Incubate with Secondary antibody**: 3hr to O.N. At 4 degrees Celsius. Secondary antibodies may also be pre-absorbed in PBTBS. For fluorescently labelled antibodies, long incubations tends to increase background levels. For Jackson laboratories antibodies dilutions of 1:400~1:600 work well.
	•	for imaginal disk secondary antibodies, use 1:1000 dilution.

**Wash**:As above

**Staining (for immunochemistry)**: transfer disks to the depression slide with 500ul of DAB-PBT. Add 0.5microL 30% H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide). Watch as reaction progresses. When sufficiently dark, rinse 3~5 times in PBT to stop reaction. DAB-waste should be mixed with some bleach, allowed to sit for 5 minutes and then discarded in a DAB container.  DAB is a carcinogen so be careful. Mount in 70% glycerol (prepared with a small crystal of phenol, to prevent growth), and seal with nail vanish. 
	•	DAB-PBT: Dilute DAB (1 mg/mL stored in aliquots at -20 degrees C - keep in the dark) 1:3-1:4 with PBT.


**Staining (for immunoflourescence)**: Mount in anti-fade (see below). Some seal in nail polish, but in my experience this can quench the fluorescence.
