Antibody Staining of Imaginal discs and larval ovaries
=====================================================

(based on Godt 1992, with Modifications by Dworkin. Also see White, R. 1998. Immunolabelling of Drosophila in Drosophila a practical approach. Roberts. DB ed. Oxford press)

**Dissection**: Dissect larvae in 1xPBS in depression slides. Remove fat body and salivary glands (optional). Transfer tissue (inverted head with wing discs) directly with forcepts into a tube or well of a micro-titer plate. Keep on ice until fixation. Use 500ul of solution per tube. Generally 10-12 "heads" per tube work.
	
**Fixation**: Fix 20 min. at room temperature (RT). Keep the tube/plate with tissue on a nutator throughout this, and all subsequent steps. 

	•	4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in 1x PBS with 50mM EGTA  (from a 0.5M stock of EGTA - may require NaOH to dissolve). This solution should be made in advance (in the fumehood, on a stir/heating plate), and stored in 1mL aliquots at -20 degrees celsius. Mix well before adding fixative to tissues.
	•	Be aware of that 4% paraformaldehyde with EGTA may not work. In that case, use 4% paraformaldehyde without EGTA.

Methanol : Transfer tissue directly with forceps into a basket with 1x PBS in a micro-titer plate. 1000ul per well for 3~5 min. at RT. Some antibodies show low binding activity with methanol fixed tissues.
	•	for storage at -20 degrees, remove methanol & add 100% ethanol after methanol fixation.
	•	Skip this step for alpha-ct antibody

Wash : Rinse with PBT, wash 4x15 min. with PBT.
	•	PBT = 1x PBS & 0.1% Tween-20. This is a good time to “clean-up” tissues post fixation (remove fat etc.)
	•	Make 50ml in a tube. Do not vortex PBT. Gently Shake!
	•	Be award of that Tween-20 has a high viscosity.

Blocking : in 750~1000ul of  PBTBS from 1 hour to overnight (O.N.) at 4 degrees. 
	•	PBTBS = PBT + 0.1% Bovine serum albumin + 2% Goat serum.
	•	PBTBS can be kept for 2~3 days at 4 degrees. 
	•	To make 3ml PBTBS :
	•	60ul GS(100% solution) + 40ul BSA(7.5% solution) + 2900ul PBT
	•	do not vortex GS but BSA is vortex-able.

Incubate with primary antibody : in 1000ul of antibody w/ PBTBS O.N. At 4 degrees. Some antibodies need to be pre-absorbed. 
	•	dilute antibody with PBTBS & shake gently.
	•	for alpha-ct, use 1:100 dilution

Wash : Rise with PBT; wash 4x 15min. RT.

Blocking : 60 minutes to O.N. In PBTBS at 4 degrees. 

Secondary antibody : 3hr to O.N. At 4 degrees. Secondary antibodies should also be pre-absorbed in PBTBS. For fluorescently labelled antibodies, long incubations tends to increase background levels. For Jackson laboratories antibodies dilutions of 1:400~1:600 work well.
	•	for imaginal disk secondary antibodies, use 1:1000 dilution.

Wash : As above

Staining (for immunochemistry) : transfer disks to the depression slide with 500ul of DAB. Watch as reaction progresses. When sufficiently dark, rinse 3~5 times in PBT to stop reaction. DAB-waste should be mixed with some bleach, allowed to sit for 5 minutes and then discarded in a DAB container.  DAB is a carcinogen so be careful. Mount in 70% glycerol (prepared with a small crystal of phenol, to prevent growth), and seal with nail vanish. 
	•	Add one drop (30ul) DAB B to 1ml of DAB Buffer. (use it immediately)
