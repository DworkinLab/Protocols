# Some unorganized notes on using Hoechst (or DAPI) as a general nuclear co-stain

 We want to figure out optimal Hoechst concentrations for imaginal disc work. What has been reported in the literature is all over the place both in terms of stock concentration and final concentration. Also whether the stock solution should be in water, PBS or DMSO!!! So here are a few unorganized notes copied from other places, that should be used to figure things out.
 
## DAPI
DAPI concentrations  anywhere from 0.1µg/mL to 10µg/mL final concentration

-Also, it's good to note, as Matthew Larkins said, that DAPI/Hoescht works at a range of concentrations. If you're interested in chromatin compaction, for instance, high concentrations will only result in an entirely blue kind of blown-out looking nucleus, while low concentrations will reveal differences between chromocenters, interchromatin space, heterochromatin and euchromatin.
-I use 1.5ug/ml but added to mounting media so I don't incubate or wash. I just add the mounting media and cover slip.


## Hoechst

Notes about hoechst concentration for various protocols

Very useful primers on using Hoechst dyes [here](https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/mp21486.pdf) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoechst_stain). Some takeaways. Dissolve Hoechst in water or DMSO to make stock solution, but not PBS. Also Hoechst 33342 has better cell permeability than Hoechst 33258. Hoechst is less toxic to cells than DAPI, so better for FACS (?). Final concentrations recommended for fixed animal cells in the 0.2 - 2ug/mL range.

Hoechst (stock concentrations either 1mg/mL or 10mg/mL). typically dilute Hoechst stock 1:2000 or so.
0.2 - 2 µg/ml final(?) - the range of 1-10 µg/mL

From the FACS protocol from the Edgar lab
Final concentration is 0.5ug/mL) made from a 500ug/mL stock solution (dissolved in DMSO.. check for antibody staining). The reasoning for DMSO is that when it is made in a PBS based solution it would precipitate out of solution.


From [this paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0107333) They used 1ug/ml in PBS for wing discs cultured *in vivo*

[this paper](http://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/124/18/3555.full.pdf) incubated in 1ug/mL (diluted in PBS) for 5 minutes.

[this paper](http://www.genetics.org/content/149/4/1867) DNA was stained for 5 min with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100.

[this paper](http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4763779) Hoechst 33342 and rhodamine phalloidin, diluted 1:500 (Life Technology). I assume Life technology has a stock solution. check concentration.

[This paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/6800408.pdf) said they incubated at 1mg/mL for 30S (way higher than everyone else).
