Overview of Dworkin lab protocols for DNA extraction and purification.
=====================================================================


This document is a quick guide to link you to the appropriate protocol for extracting genomic DNA depending upon the particular needs of your experiment.  Currently this is geared towards our work with Drosophila DNA. For our work with Radish DNA (and genomes) I will add seperate protocols.

1. For "quick and dirty" DNA preparations that are sufficient for basic PCR based assays (like PCR-RFLP genotyping) then we generally use the squish prep protocol. 

2. For high quality high molecular weight genomic DNA that we use either for genome resequencing (whether individual genomes or pooled resequencing) we use one of three kits/protocols.

2A. Zymo Insect DNA.

2B. Qiagen

2C. DNAzol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.
