# This is our short protocol for examining GFP based reporters in imaginal discs.

-   Dissect imaginal disc (late third instar) as normal.
-   Tissues  are fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at RT
-   Tissues washed in PBT for 10 min. 
-   Tissues placed in Anti-fade Mountant with Hoechst (33342) added to a 1:15000 dilution (1:10000 works as well). 
-   Tissues vessles wrapped with foil. After 5 min incubation the imaginal disc are dissected on a slide.

Remember that paraformaldehyde should be made fresh every 6 months (or else it produces chemical byproducts that quench GFP).
Once a stock of 4% PF is made in a batch, freeze small aliquots. WHole batch should be replaced every 6 months. Check recipe in molecular lab, but I think it is made in PBS.
