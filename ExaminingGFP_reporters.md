# This is our short protocol for examining GFP based reporters in imaginal discs.

See [this page](https://github.com/DworkinLab/Protocols/blob/master/WingDiscAntibodyStaining.md) for recipes and more information.

-   Dissect imaginal disc (late third instar) as normal. i.e. invert anterior half of larvae, remove fat body and salivary glands.
-   Tissues  are fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at RT. Any longer can denture too much of the GFP. I have seen some recommendations for 1% paraformaldehyde, but have not tried this yet. See note below
-   Tissues rinsed 3 times in PBT and then washed in PBT for 10 min. 
-   Tissues placed in Anti-fade Mountant. If nuclear co-stain is needed, use with Hoechst (33342) added to a 1:15000 dilution (1:10000 and even 1:1000 works as well depending on application). 
-   Tissues vessels wrapped with foil. After 5 min incubation the imaginal disc are dissected on a slide.
-   Do not seal with nail polish as this may quench the GFP. So slide must be treated carefully.

Remember that paraformaldehyde should be made fresh every 6 months (or else it produces chemical byproducts that quench GFP).
Once a stock of 4% PF is made in a batch, freeze small aliquots. **Whole batch should be replaced every 6 months**. Check recipe in molecular lab!

**Note:** It may be the paraformaldehyde based changes to GFP are actually reversible. See [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4992). i.e. treatment with alkaline buffer solutions (such as 0.1â€‰M Na2CO3, pH=11.6).
