# Recipes for stock solutions and other reagents for the lab.

## Phosphate Buffered Sailine (PBS)

Use: PBS is used as a general saline buffer for dissection of imaginal discs (and other tissues) for RNA extraction, antibody stainings, examining GFP reporters in discs etc.. Also used as component for other solution (i.e. PBS/glycerol) for mounting.

**Note:** For routine use of PBS (for mountants for instance) homemade 10X PBS is fine. For applications for RNA extraction, we typically by PBS that is certified RNase free.


## PBT (with Tween-20 as the detergent)

Use: PBS buffer with detergent. Detergent increases permeability of cell membrane (breaks holes in cell membrane), to allow passage of small molecules (like antibodies, GFP, DAPI, Hoechst, Phalloidin, etc..).

## PBT (Triton-X)

Use: PBS buffer with detergent. Detergent increases permeability of cell membrane (breaks wholes in cell membrane), to allow passage of small molecules (like antibodies).

## PBTBS (PBT with blocking solution)

Use:

## 4% Paraformaldehyde

Use: Fixative for immunofluorescence (antibody staining).

## anti-fade mountant (for immunofluorescence).

Use:
