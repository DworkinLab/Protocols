# Some of my old notes about using the EPMotion 5070 liquid handling robot. 

Note: These notes are not useful in a general way, but will be included as we update the protocol for programming the liquid handling robot.

Notes on Using the EPmotion 5070


Plates- For raised rim Denville makes a heat seal.  For Fisher and AB use clear caps.

 EP MOTION

 4 Deck positions.
Use thermoblocks for no skirt or semi skirt plates.  Full skirt plates will not likely need the thermoblocks (i.e. twin tec full skirt).

Inside the EP Folder are some templates. 
When placing thermoblocks into EPmotion make sure writing is facing out towards you.

The system is built around a volume optical sensor, which can detect 300 microL or more. However the tool can also be set to aspirate from the bottom, or a volume can be defined for each tube.

 Accuracy: The 50 microL tool can be used to dispense as low as 1 microL with high accuracy  & precision. However, for multi-dispensing from the same tip, 1 microL will not be as accurate (but 2-3 should be ok).  

 Alternatively a tip can be "re-used" if it is just dispensing, and not mixing. However,  the tips do suffer wear and tear, so replace them after  ~ 20 aspirate-dispense cycles.
